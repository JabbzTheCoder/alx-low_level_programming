Everything you need to know to start coding your own shell

PID & PPID:
A process is an instance of an executing program, that has a unique process ID. This process ID is used by many functions and system calls to interact with and manipulate processes. In order to retrieve the current processâ€™ ID, you can use the system call getpid (man 2 getpid)

Arguments:
The command line arguments are passed through the main function: int main(int ac, char **av);

av is a NULL terminated array of strings
ac is the number of items in av
av[0] usually contains the name used to invoke the current program. av[1] is the first argument of the program, av[2] the second, and so on.
